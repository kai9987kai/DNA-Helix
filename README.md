# DNA-Helix

A **single-file, standalone HTML/CSS/JS** project that renders a **DNA double-helix** visualization/animation in the browser.

- **Repo type:** minimalist / no-build / open-in-browser
- **Primary file:** `index.html`
- **Tech:** HTML + CSS + JavaScript (no external build tooling)

---

## What’s in this repo

- `index.html` — the complete demo (markup, styling, and scripts in one file)

---

## Run locally

### Option A — Open directly
You can usually run this by double-clicking:

- `index.html`

Some browsers restrict certain behaviors under `file://`, so Option B is recommended.

### Option B — Serve with a tiny local web server (recommended)
